/* File: button_solution.c
 * Description: C program for the ATMEL AVR microcontroller (ATmega32 chip)
 * Turn on Teensy LED with button

 * Teensy PewPew

 * Includes (pretty much compulsory for using the Teensy this semester)
 * 	- avr/io.h: port and pin definitions (i.e. DDRB, PORTB, PB1, etc)
 *
 *	- cpu_speed.h: macros for forcing the CPU speed to 8MHz (nothing else should ever be used!)
